There are two major robots: Rosie and Bender.

Users add the robots by clicking on the robot button of the appropriate name.

After adding Bender, a new button will appear that will allow Bender to make a mess.

After adding Rosie, a new button will apear to will allow Rosie to clean up Bender's mess.

Rosie can also say, "Hello".

I am using a pseudo-classical instatiation pattern that builds off of the Robot class. I use the setPosition method
on the Robot class' prototype to assign a x and y value to each of the robots.
